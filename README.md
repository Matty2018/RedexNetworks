Hello Member!
I have released a minecraft mods server which requires forge. Forge is a modded version of minecraft. Im guessing you are reading this because you don't know what you are doing with the mods.

Tutorial
1) Install Minecraft Forge
	(Minecraft forge is already in the pack :) just to make it easier for you )
2) Press LeftWIN + R to open the run.cmd and type in the box %appdata%
3) In appdata you should see a file called .minecraft In there there should be a folder called mods if not create one with all lower capitals
4) Go into this folder. Go into the mods folder.
5) Take the mods from there and place them in your mods folder for minecraft
6) Open minecraft and select forge launch option
	You can do this by pressing the Up arrow next to the game version
7) Launch and connect to the server here - 	193.70.81.33:25601
8) Enjoy

All mods are in a queue. To view this go here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjY2-bKqRhCq9r_ewEKkIbaL7KMCKuoC7PkUHRa0x5I/edit?usp=sharing
